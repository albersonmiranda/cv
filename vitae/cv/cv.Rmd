# Software

da Silva Miranda A (2024). _fio: Friendly Input-Output Analysis_. R package version 0.1.6, <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fio>.

The `fio` package was written in the context of my PhD, when studying input-output analysis. It uses Rust programming language to speed up linear algebra operations and it's currently the fastest software for input-output analysis.
